Problems:

When trying to set a page background color, Bootstrap was overiding any parameters I entered.
I found that applying a more specific parameter would allow the parameters that I set to be applied.

Kept getting a runtime error on the javascript file, even when the file was empty. 
I found that if all of Google Chrome's extensions were disabled, then the error would not appear.
